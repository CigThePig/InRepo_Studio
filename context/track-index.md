# Track Index (Roadmap → Tracks)

Purpose:
- Defines the ordered track sequence for building InRepo Studio. Tracks are added as phases expand — do not assume a fixed count.
- Each Track is a bounded unit of work that produces a verifiable improvement.

Each Track must produce:
- spec.md (intent + acceptance)
- blueprint.md (technical design: files/APIs/state/risks; **NO CODE**)
- plan.md (phases + verification per phase + stop points)

Rules:
- Follow track order unless explicitly overridden.
- Tracks should be achievable without touching too many systems at once.
- Update `INDEX.md`, `context/repo-map.md`, and `context/schema-registry.md` when relevant.

## Critical Path (Vertical Slice)

The minimum to prove the architecture:

```
Track 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 10 → 11 → 12 → 13
```

| Step | Track | Name | Phase |
|------|-------|------|-------|
| 1 | Track 1 | Data Structures | 0.1 |
| 2 | Track 2 | Hot Storage | 0.2 |
| 3 | Track 3 | Cold Storage | 0.3 |
| 4 | Track 4 | Boot System | 0.4 |
| 5 | Track 5 | Canvas System | 1.1 |
| 6 | Track 6 | Panels + Tile Picker | 1.2, 1.3, 2.1 |
| 7 | Track 7 | Tilemap Rendering | 2.2 |
| 8 | Track 8 | Paint Tool | 2.3 |
| 9 | Track 10 | Playtest Bridge | 4.1 |
| 10 | Track 11 | Runtime Loader | 4.2 |
| 11 | Track 12 | Authentication | 5.1 |
| 12 | Track 13 | Deploy Flow | 5.2 |

**Note on Track 9**: Touch Foundation (1.4) refines gesture disambiguation and touch offset calibration. It's recommended before Track 10 for polish, but basic painting works without it. Include it if touch interactions feel imprecise.

This gets you to: open editor → paint tiles → playtest locally → deploy → verify on live site.

🔷 Editor V2 Migration (UI + Workflow Overhaul)

Global Rule for All Tracks Below

All implementation must follow:

context/editor-v2-architecture.md

If any existing system conflicts with that spec, the spec wins.

Do not keep duplicate legacy systems alive unless the track explicitly says it is temporary.


---

🟦 Track 23 — Bottom Interaction Strip (Replace Floating Selection Bars)

Activates Editor V2 Bottom Bar Behavior

Goal

Move all selection action UI from floating popups into the bottom bar interaction strip.

entitySelectionBar.ts (entity selection popup)


New System Authority

Bottom bar becomes the single source of contextual selection actions.


Includes

1. Add a bottom context strip area to the bottom bar.


2. When tiles are selected, show tile selection actions in the strip.


3. When entities are selected, show entity selection actions in the strip.


4. Keep old floating bars only as a temporary fallback behind a feature flag.

No selection actions appear as floating popups during normal use.

Bottom strip dynamically changes based on current selection.

Top bar only contains:

Undo

Redo

Settings

Test/Play



Includes

1. Move Undo/Redo into top bar.


2. Remove layer UI from top bar.


3. Ensure no editing tools depend on top bar.



Completion Criteria

Top bar never changes based on editing mode.
